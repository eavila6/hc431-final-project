                    <p>You might know that on May 2nd, 2023, Hollywood was brought to its knees as members of the Writer’s Guild of America (WGA) began to protest.
                        Maybe one of your favorite shows was hit pretty hard from this ordeal.
                        But the strike isn’t on unfounded grounds as there’s legitimate reasons for often unthanked and unrecognized workers to be concerned.
                    </p>
                    <p>Huge technological leaps have made writers worried about the stability of their job.
                        Impressively coherent and advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT threaten to replace the writers of our beloved shows much like the printing press rendered handwritten methods obsolete.
                        Media streaming platforms (streaming) like NetFlix, Disney+, and Amazon Prime Video don’t make matters any better by dancing around what’s owed to the writers largely in part to the novelty of this service.

                    <p>
                        Thankfully the members of the WGA are not alone in their struggles, as the path to success has been outlined by the work done many years earlier by the members of the International Workers of the World— A.K.A the Wobblies— as well as the ideology of 20th century philosopher Franz Fanon.
                        In fact, perhaps the success of the WGA strike— as well as potentially your future involvement in labor rights— can be predicted by the synthesis of the Wobbly ideology with that of Fanon’s.
