                    <p>You might know that on May 2nd, 2023, Hollywood was brought to its knees as members of the Writer’s Guild of America (WGA) began to protest.
                        Most daily shows were forced to air reruns and some content in the making predicted delays in their release dates.
                        Maybe you heard one of your favorite shows was hit pretty hard because of this.
                        What you might not have known is that the writers—
                        who have been historically unthanked and unrecognized for their work in the industry—
                        have pressing concerns about their job security, which is the main reason why they’re on strike.
                    </p>
                    <p>Huge technological leaps now threaten to make the writer’s job obsolete thanks to impressively coherent and advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT much like the printing press rendered handwritten methods obsolete.
                        Media streaming platforms (best known as streaming) like NetFlix, Disney+, and Amazon Prime Video don’t make matters any better by undervaluing the writer’s work and  dancing around attempts to redeem what’s owed to them largely in part to the novelty of this service.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Thankfully the members of the WGA are not alone in their struggles, as the path to success has been outlined by the work done many years earlier by the members of the International Workers of the World—
                        A.K.A the Wobblies—
                        as well as the ideology of 20th century philosopher Franz Fanon.
                        Unfortunately, because of the dire nature of the situation, strikers will have to employ violence as outlined in Wobbly literature and in Fanon’s work in order to achieve what they need to continue working in a dignified and respected manner.
